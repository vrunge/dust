# 1) small data competition
# compare the runtime of all the algorithms on relatively small sample sizes (n = 100 to 100 000 or 10 000)
# depending on your laptop capacity

# 2)  big data competition
# do the same but on the lab server for bigger data size (10^6 to 10^9)

# 3) number of indices
# pruning context = how many indices we need to save
# study (when possible) and compare the number of indices to save between FPOP and dust algorithms
