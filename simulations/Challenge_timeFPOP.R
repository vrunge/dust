### TO DO LIST ###

# 1) review
# review of the R packages used to detect changes in univariate data
# = change in mean, in variance, in Poisson data, in negative binomial.
#
# ask Liudmila, Guillem, Arnaud, Owen, Gaetano ("g romano" <g.romano@lancaster.ac.uk>)
#
# we will focus on exact algorithms using dynamic programming (= optimal partitioning algorithms)
# with a standard penalty (BIC)
# = algo PELT, OP, FPOP...

# 2) possible bugs
# = run the algorithms on "difficult" data and verify that they return all the same results
# for example: data = 0,...,0 or with outliers, or... (ask me + my colleagues)

# 3) small data competition
# compare the runtime of all the algorithms on relatively small sample sizes (n = 100 to 100 000 or 10 000)
# depending on your laptop capacity

# 4)  big data competition
# do the same but on the lab server for bigger data size (10^6 to 10^9)

# 5) number of indices
# pruning context = how many indices we need to save
# study (when possible) and compare the number of indices to save between FPOP and dust algorithms
