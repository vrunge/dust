\title{Compute the Total Segmentation Cost in One Dimension with Various Models}
\usage{
segmentation_Cost_1D(data, chpts, model = "gauss")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector representing the one-dimensional data to be segmented.}

\item{chpts}{A numeric vector of change-points. These indices represent the locations where the data is segmented.
The vector should contain indices before any adjustments.}

\item{model}{A character string specifying the cost model to be used. Supported models include \code{"gauss"},
\code{"poisson"}, \code{"exp"}, \code{"geom"}, \code{"bern"}, \code{"binom"}, \code{"negbin"},
and \code{"variance"}. The default model is \code{"gauss"}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the total segmentation cost.
}
\description{
This function calculates the total segmentation cost for one-dimensional data using various models, such as Gaussian, Poisson, Exponential, and others.
It computes the segmentation cost for each segment defined by change-points (\code{chpts}) and sums these costs to provide a total segmentation cost.
}
\details{
For each segment defined by two consecutive change-points, the function applies \code{\link{Cost_1D}}, which calculates the cost of the segment based on the provided model. Supported models include:

\itemize{
  \item{\code{"gauss"}}: {Gaussian model, computes the negative log-likelihood under the Gaussian distribution.}
  \item{\code{"poisson"}}: {Poisson model.}
  \item{\code{"exp"}}: {Exponential model.}
  \item{\code{"geom"}}: {Geometric model.}
  \item{\code{"bern"}}: {Bernoulli model.}
  \item{\code{"binom"}}: {Binomial model.}
  \item{\code{"negbin"}}: {Negative Binomial model.}
  \item{\code{"variance"}}: {Variance-based cost model.}
}

If the model is \code{"gauss"}, the function adds an additional term \code{sum(data^2)/2} to the total cost to ensure that the cost is zero when the data is perfectly segmented with no noise.

data <- rnorm(100)  # Generate some random Gaussian data
chpts <- c(25, 50, 75, 100)  # Example change-points
